This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Search Process

The search is across buckets:
1. Subject Tag (GS1-4, Optionals, Essays) (Multiple)
   1. Done at a page level then transcended to document
   2. Uses simple query on page level, can be aggregated from a subset
2. Topper Tag (Multiple)
   1. Uses simple query on doc
3. Document Type (Single)
   1. Uses simple query on doc
4. Keyword Search (Single)
